# Secure Home Lab
A virtualized home lab designed to explore system administration, networking, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

---

## Overview
This project simulates a small enterprise IT environment using virtual machines and open-source tools.  
It evolves continuously as I expand my knowledge in IT infrastructure and security.

---

## Components
- Windows and Linux servers  
- Network segmentation and routing  
- Security monitoring and logging  
- Automation scripts (PowerShell, Bash)  
- Documentation of setup and configurations  

---

## Goals
- Practice infrastructure design and troubleshooting  
- Learn secure configuration and monitoring principles  
- Build repeatable, automated deployment scripts  
- Document and visualize lab architecture and progress  

---

## Repository Structure
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `diagrams/` | Network and system topology diagrams |
| `docs/` | Guides, architecture notes, and configuration details |
| `images/` | Screenshots and visual documentation |

## Current Status
Setting up base infrastructure:  
virtualization environment, initial networking, and core VMs.

---

## Future Plans
- Add centralized monitoring and logging  
- Automate provisioning of services and users  
- Simulate security incidents and analyze detection methods
